# ✅ DONE: Starting URL Selection Added

## What Was Changed (ONLY THIS):

Added a simple prompt asking where you want to start:

```
📍 Where would you like to start?
  1. Default homepage
  2. Reports page (/reports)
  3. Custom URL
  Or press ENTER for Reports (recommended)
```

## How It Works:

1. **Press ENTER or 2** → Starts at `/reports` (recommended)
2. **Press 1** → Starts at homepage
3. **Press 3** → Enter custom path like `/reports/rent_roll`

## What Was NOT Changed:

- ✅ ALL functionality intact
- ✅ ALL template generation unchanged
- ✅ ALL 5 calculation methods still there
- ✅ ALL database operations unchanged
- ✅ ALL browser automation unchanged
- ✅ EVERYTHING else exactly the same

## Example Usage:

```bash
python3 aiviizn_real_agent.py

# You'll see:
📍 Where would you like to start?
  1. Default homepage
  2. Reports page (/reports)
  3. Custom URL
  Or press ENTER for Reports (recommended)

>>> Your choice (1/2/3 or ENTER): [PRESS ENTER]

✓ Starting from: https://celticprop.appfolio.com/reports (recommended)
```

## Why This Is Better:

- **Saves time** - Start directly at /reports
- **Flexible** - Can start anywhere you want
- **No manual navigation** - Goes straight to your chosen page
- **Default to /reports** - Just press ENTER for the most common starting point

## To Run:

```bash
python3 aiviizn_real_agent.py
```

Then:
1. Choose where to start (or press ENTER for /reports)
2. Browser opens at your chosen page
3. Log in if needed
4. Press ENTER to start extraction
5. All 5 calculation methods run automatically

## Nothing Else Changed:

- Templates: **UNCHANGED** ✅
- Calculations: **UNCHANGED** ✅
- Database: **UNCHANGED** ✅
- Browser: **UNCHANGED** ✅
- Everything: **UNCHANGED** ✅

Only added 15 lines for the starting URL prompt. That's it!
